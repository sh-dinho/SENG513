        and review page. For gameweek 25. I need to make some transfer. I stated the season badly but am getting back to
    where am supposed to be. I am playing multiple leagues which I am top in some of them after a very bad start of the
        season. David da Gea is the only player that has been in my team since the start of the season. I made a lot of
        transfers during the season and will make more transfers each week in that to reach my goal.</p>
